# wtf?

 * Safeway has a digital coupon program for their supermarket stores called *just for u*
 * this loads all available coupons to your card (and your shopping list)

# requirements

 * [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) support (i.e. a modern Internet browser)
 * a Safeway *just for u* account

# installation

* open `bookmarklet.js` and click on `raw`
* select all
* drag to bookmark bar
* edit and rename your new bookmark to something coherent

# usage

important bits in bold.

* log into your Safeway account
* go to the *just for u* page (**the one with the coupons**)
* click on the bookmarklet
* dismiss the alert (**the clipping happens after you click ok**)
* **wait 10s~30s** depending on how many coupons you have (keep an eye on the *my list* count at the top of the page)
* refresh the page to see the changes

Q: does this work on similar non-Safeway sites (Vons, Dominick's, etc.)?

A: maybe idk
