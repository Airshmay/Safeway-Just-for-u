If you're here, you know what this is.

nota bene: the website no longer distinguishes between "adding to card" and "adding to list".

Clicking on the "add" button normally via the website adds the offer to both your card and list.
This script only loads offers to your card, keeping your shopping list uncluttered.

You should be able to confirm that offers are added to card via the mobile app--old versions will display "added to card" under the product images.
